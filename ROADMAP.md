# Maverick Roadmap

Status: user-first reset.

## Current Milestone

The sole milestone and its pass conditions live in `STATUS.md`. This document
only orders work; it does not restate current completion or audit status.

## Execution Order

1. **Publish an Alpha.3 prerelease only after repository review.** Commit and
   push the reviewed candidate, then build the same standalone artifacts already
   defined by the release workflow. This does not make the project Beta.
2. **Request one short, bounded owner retest.** Re-time installation and check
   video playback, slow images, and lingering page-load completion. Do not
   assume the local fix resolved any field symptom. A new live run requires new
   explicit authorization.
3. **Decide whether Beta is justified.** Enter Beta only if the owner retest
   beats five minutes and the important browsing failures are either gone or
   understood with an acceptable documented boundary. Otherwise remain Alpha
   and fix only the next reproduced cause.
4. **Track native server-side ECH upstream.** Keep the current provider-fronted
   path labeled as a workaround, not ECH. Do not fork rustls or vendor an
   unmerged ECH patch in the current plan.

## Work Explicitly Stopped

- No Phase 3 recovery, replacement, or renamed certification loop.
- No new receipt, seal, registry, watchdog, evidence schema, or dynamic
  orchestration framework.
- No HPKE, Noise, ML-KEM, multi-hop, no-domain, governance, standardization, or
  broad ecosystem work before the first pilot.
- No production-readiness relabeling from local tests or disposable-VM package
  installation.
- No rustls fork or vendored unmerged server-ECH patch in the current execution
  plan.
- No remote, paid, privileged, or host-network action outside the current
  authorization recorded in `STATUS.md`.

## Failure-Driven Follow-Up

Use the shortest failure-driven next step:

- install failed -> simplify the artifact;
- daily use failed -> fix reliability/usability;
- TLS fingerprint was blocked -> improve the default TLS/handshake path;
- active probe distinguished the server -> harden handshake/fallback behavior;
- pilot passed -> repeat with one additional consenting user before widening
  platform, protocol, packaging, or governance scope.

`protocol_version` and config `version` remain `1` during this reset. Any future
wire or config change requires an explicit compatibility decision based on
observed user need.
