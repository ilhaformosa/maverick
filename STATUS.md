# Maverick Status

Date: 2026-07-22

This is the only active current-truth document. Archived plans, manifests,
evidence records, and release notes do not override it.

## Direction Decision

Phase 3 and every recovery alias are terminally retired. The incomplete result
remains `No-Go`; no product result was produced, no server is active, and no
lease or run is active. This user-first direction is a new product-learning
track, not an amendment, completion, or relabeling of Phase 3.

Progress now means:

> A real person uses the real product to complete a real task.

Passing tests, safe rejection, hashes, manifests, and evidence tooling are
quality controls. They do not count as product progress on their own.

## One-Page Pilot Strategy

### 1. Who is the first user?

The first user is the project owner on an owner-controlled spare macOS laptop.
No friend, journalist, activist, or otherwise at-risk third party is recruited
for the first pilot. The task is ordinary, non-sensitive web use through
Maverick during one 24-hour observation window; continuous browsing is not
required.

### 2. What is the first adversary?

The first adversary model is the access-network observer on the selected pilot
path. It may block endpoints using TLS metadata or traffic fingerprints and may
actively probe the public server. The primary client path for this pilot is one
privately identified, owner-controlled lawful restricted access network; its
type, provider, address, endpoint, and location are not public project data. A
second access-network run would be a separate later test. No claim is made about
a named country, firewall, or censorship system unless the test actually
produces evidence that supports it.

### 3. How does the user get the software?

The first distribution channel is a GitHub prerelease containing a standalone
`maverick` CLI binary and one short start/check guide for each supported pilot
target. The user generates fresh credentials and two minimal configs locally;
public archives never carry shared credentials. `./scripts/build-pilot.sh`
produces the same shareable archive from a source checkout. A package repository,
updater, GUI, and broad platform matrix are not prerequisites. The five-minute
install path is not yet validated by a fresh user.

### 4. What are the field threats?

The first field threats are:

- install or configuration friction that prevents use;
- a distinguishable client TLS/H2 profile;
- active probes receiving a Maverick-specific response;
- connection instability during normal daily use;
- DNS, timing, volume, endpoint-IP, and destination metadata that Maverick does
  not currently hide.

Compromised endpoints, a malicious server operator, global traffic correlation,
and destination-site browser fingerprinting remain outside this pilot.

## North-Star Result

The first milestone passes only when all of the following are true:

1. the owner installs the pilot artifact in five minutes without developer
   intervention;
2. the owner performs ordinary browsing during one 24-hour observation window
   on the privately named, lawful real-network path;
3. the default client uses the browser-like TLS/H2 path;
4. ordinary browsing works well enough to finish the day;
5. the record contains no Maverick-specific active-probe response and no
   observed block attributable to the tested Maverick fingerprint;
6. failures and unknowns are recorded plainly.

This result would still be one pilot, not proof of anonymity, broad
censorship resistance, production readiness, or browser identity.

## Current Product Truth

- Workspace version: `1.2.0-alpha.1`.
- Protocol version: `1` (unchanged).
- Config version: `1` (unchanged).
- Rust product core and loopback relay path: implemented.
- Browser-like TLS backend: default build path on supported targets.
- Generated client profile: browser-like TLS/H2 by default on supported targets.
- Handshake-hiding primary implementation: browser-like TLS over CDN-fronted H2
  is implemented and loopback-verified. TLS exporter channel binding is
  disabled across provider termination because the two TLS connections cannot
  share an exporter. The owner has accepted Cloudflare TLS termination only for
  this owner-only 24-hour pilot and understands that Cloudflare can observe
  Maverick authentication information and tunnel traffic. Real-provider
  operation remains unvalidated; the older WebSocket carrier remains a rustls
  compatibility path.
- Local correct-credential relay and wrong-credential rejection: covered by
  `./scripts/user-smoke.sh`.
- Single-binary owner-pilot folder and shareable archive: generated locally by
  `./scripts/build-pilot.sh`; version tags publish equivalent GitHub prerelease
  assets for the supported pilot targets. Fresh-user timing remains untested.
- Python coordination/validation tooling: frozen under `scripts/archive/python/`.
- Former remote/evidence shell orchestration: frozen under
  `scripts/archive/legacy/`.
- Non-current documents and machine-readable production ledgers: archived under
  `docs/archive/`.
- Real five-minute install by a fresh user: not yet demonstrated.
- Owner-only, 24-hour real-network pilot: authorized but not started.
- Owner-confirmed audit checkpoint (2026-07-21): the latest formal independent
  security audit of the then-current repository code completed with no open
  findings reported. This is a point-in-time result, not a warranty,
  certification, or claim that later changes inherit the same review.
- Future formal audits are optional and are not a pilot, release, or progress
  requirement. Open-source users remain responsible for deciding whether the
  software and its threat model fit their use.
- Production, anonymity, censorship-resistance, and exact browser-equivalence
  claims: not made.

## Authorization Boundary

Repository-local work may build, test, and use `127.0.0.1` with OS-assigned
ephemeral ports. The following owner authorization applies only to the first
pilot and does not create standing authorization for later runs:

- person and client: the owner on one owner-controlled spare macOS laptop;
- client path: the privately identified, owner-controlled lawful restricted
  access network; a second access-network test is outside this run;
- duration and use: one 24-hour observation window, ordinary non-sensitive web
  use, and no recruited third party;
- client network changes: application-local proxy configuration only; no system
  proxy, DNS, route, firewall, VPN, interface, or network-service change;
- CDN trust: Cloudflare may terminate TLS for this run; the owner accepts that
  it can observe Maverick authentication information and tunnel traffic;
- CDN change scope: only one dedicated pilot hostname and its new DNS record;
  do not modify existing records or zone-wide settings;
- Cloudflare spend: paid-product budget is `US$0`;
- origin: at most one small owner-controlled VPS, retained for at most seven
  days, with total pilot spend capped at `US$10`;
- excluded purchases: backups, additional disks, load balancers, and every
  other paid add-on; and
- stop rule: any additional resource, duration, person, network, trust change,
  or possible cost above these limits requires a new owner decision first.

Provider access, creation of the single origin, narrowly scoped SSH setup, and
creation of the Cloudflare route are permitted inside this envelope only after
the exact provider account or team, neutral resource name, region, containing
owner-controlled zone, and dedicated pilot hostname are confirmed privately.
The selected zone must already use Cloudflare Full (strict), or equivalent
origin-authenticated TLS, and H2-to-origin; otherwise stop for a separate owner
decision rather than changing zone-wide settings. Credentials, account
identifiers, real endpoints, and private environment details must not enter the
repository. No per-run hash approval is required.

The next legal actions are to confirm those private targets, rehearse the
published install path, provision the authorized route, and then run the pilot.
None of those actions counts as a product result until the North-Star Result is
actually observed and recorded.
